## Whats New [v1010]

- [x] Add thread modes for proxy browsers
- [x] More descriptive errors
- [x] Automatic updater update

## Instructions

You need the following python packages installed: argparse, selenium, requests, ptable

You can install all by:

### Windows 

> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

### Linux

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

or

> python3-pip install -r requirements.txt

You will need Firefox installed on the system. Gecko driver executable file is provieded for Windows users. Linux users can enjoy without any executables, as long as Firefox is installed.


## To-Do

- [x] Add argument configurations to core folder
- [x] Custom help menu
- [x] Allow single and pool of browser to run at a time
- [ ] Add support for other proxy sites
- [ ] Automatic logging
- [x] Auto updater update
- [ ] Auto backup and update proxy list
- [ ] Convert script log to PDF format

*Note:* For some weird reason, proxy browser after grab is making the proxy servers refuse connections :< But regular command without grab works fine..

## Example Command (proxy browser)

The following command will perform these actions:

 - start 5 proxied browsers, with your url for 240 seconds

 - start proxies browser in headless mode (specifically). Default is normal mode

> python fp.py -pb -pu "https://your_website.com/" -ts 240 -mb 5 -bm headless


## Example Command (proxy grab)

The following command will perform these actions:

 - grab HTTP proxies

 - Do not check for dead proxies: optimal, faster

 - Save only 50 proxies to file (limit)

 - Save into custom filename (default name = proxies.txt)

> python fp.py -t http -l 50 --filename your_filename_without_spaces.txt -nocheck

## Example Command (Thread Modes)

There are 3 modes available for proxy browser threading.

<b>multi</b> mode is the default mode and starts all the browser threads together. This mode fine for systems with really good specs and when less browsers are opened.

<b>multipool</b> mode is my favorite mode. It divides the threads into pool of threads safely. This allows us to run a a lot of proxied browsers without having to worry about hardware specs. Makes botting efficient for low spec systems.

<b>single</b> mode runs one browser thread at a time. This is for potatoe systems with very low specs or ones that don't want multiple threads running together. This is safer because it only starts new thread once the previous browser thread exits.

### multi mode command

No need for extra command because this is default. But anyway:

> python fp.py -pb -pu https://yourwebsite.com/ -mb 300 -tm multi -ts 120

### multipool mode command

Following command will do this:

- Safely divide 300 proxy browser threads into pools of 10 browser threads
- Time to keep each thread open after site load will be 120 seconds

> python fp.py -pb -pu https://yourwebsite.com/ -mb 300 -tm multipool -pn 10 -ts 120

This mode is great xD

### single mode command

- Will open one browser at a time. Next browser will open only when the previous thread exits

> python fp.py -pb -pu https://yourwebsite.com/ -mb 300 -tm single -ts 120

## Example Command (proxy browser after grab)

The following command will perform these actions:

 - grab HTTP proxies

 - Do not check for dead proxies: optimal, faster

 - Save only 50 proxies to file (limit)

 - start 5 proxied browsers, with your url for 240 seconds

 - start proxies browser in normal mode (specifically). Default is normal mode

> python fp.py -t http -l 50 -nocheck -pb -pu https://www.yoursite.com/ -ts 240 -mb 5 -bm normal
